Severity Levels:
Critical - vulnerabilities that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated actor and lead to Zabbix compromise without requiring user interaction or allow remote unauthorized users to gain Super Admin privileges. Please install required updates or apply workarounds as soon as possible.

High - vulnerabilities that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Zabbix components. These vulnerabilities allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow remote unauthorized users to view information in Zabbix or allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code. Install required updates based on your maintenance window.

Medium - vulnerabilities that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of Zabbix under certain circumstances. Such vulnerabilities could have a Critical or High severity but are less easily exploited and/or affect unlikely configurations. Evaluate possible risks and install updates if it is required.

Low - other vulnerabilities that may have a security impact. Such vulnerabilities require unlikely circumstances to be exploited, or their successful exploitation would give minimal consequences. Evaluate possible risks and install updates if it is required.
